# Contributing to Engine Yard v6 Cookbooks repository

We're glad you want to contribute to a Engine Yard v6 Cookbooks repository ! This document will help answer common questions you may have during your first contribution.

## Steps required for Pull Request submitting

1. Ensure you are working in a branch in <b>ey-cookbooks-stable-v6</b>
 * Please do not fork to another repository, as this can prevent us from
   making minor changes to your code that may otherwise prevent your commit
   from being accepted.
 * The branch should be named after the feature being worked on. Ticket id (For example: CC-1123 ) should be used instead of feature name if you are Engine Yard employee.
2. Rebase your branch against the most recent version of the master branch:
  * `git fetch --all && git rebase -i origin/master`
  * Squash all the commits down to a single commit, with a summary commit
    message with the ticket as a prefix
    (e.g.: [CC-199] Enables users to ..."
3. Use the following Pull Request template in the description field

```
Description of your patch
-------------

Recommended Release Notes
-------------

Estimated risk
-------------

Components involved
-------------

Dependencies
-------------

Description of testing done
-------------

QA Instructions
-------------
```

_Notes:_
For "Estimated risk", specify low, medium or high, and justify your selection.
"Components involved" should list not the files changed, but the area of work (i.e.: a region specific change, customers on ruby 1.8.7, all node customers, etc).
"Dependencies" should state if this PR depends on another one, which must be merged first.
If for example, the PR was created by branching off of another feature branch (not master), 
then the PR depends on that branch and needs to state that clearly.
PRs that depend on others will only be considered if the parent PR is ready for review and testing.

## Steps after submitting your Pull Request

1. Update the ticket to 'Pull Request' status, and add a link to the pull
   request
1. Do not continue to do work in the branch used for the pull request -- PRs
   are automatically updated with any changes
1. Monitor your pull request for updates.  Your pull request will be reviewed
   on or before each Thursday at 8:30 am Pacific.  Any deficiencies found must
   be rectified by 12:pm Pacific to make it into that week's release.
